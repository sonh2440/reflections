How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

-Dont look through the whole amount of code
-direct comparison to make changes more obvious

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-Dont waste time with finding mistakes
-See what change of code affects functional changes of your code (without changing it all the time)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

contra: 
-maybe you forget a commit
-you also save not working code
pro:
-you only save working and logical working code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because they work together and are not usable individually

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log
(go out with q)
git diff 'last version' 'new version'


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

no problem anymore, you can always revert the changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
